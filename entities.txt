A warehouse company has recently started up and requires a database to keep track of its inventory. It needs to be able to keep information on products such as the product ID and name, the price, and the amount in stock. It will also need data on suppliers for products and data on sales. Having a database will allow the warehouse to be more successful, as having important data stored and readily accessible makes working for the business far more convenient.
